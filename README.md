# Deeplabcut_KAIST
Changed DeepLabCut for Synaptic Brain Dysfunctions Lab in KAIST, South Korea.

Forked from commit https://github.com/altairlight/DeepLabCut/commit/195c32e3aa05fce46c57639e238ab3525682ccb8 and some of it's codes have been fixed. 

You can use this code by 3 steps.

1. Please copy this code to a new environment of your anaconda3(python version 3.6.x, you should rewrite while your copying)

2. Next, you should copy some files of Desktop_Files to your desktop. For analyzing linear chamber test, you may need to download these files.

    1)Deeplabcut Guide

    2)LinearChamber-KAIST-2018-11-19
    
    3)LinearChamber2-KAIST-2019-01-07
    
    4)projects (which have .ipynb files)
    
    5)Video_files_Deeplabcut
    
    6)Video_files_other
    
    But you know, I'm sorry that I cannot share full project folders(2, 3) and video files(5, 6) through github website(because of copyright issues and problem with size of this git repo) 
    
    So, if you need the files and you can prove you are related to our Synaptic Brain Dysfunctions Lab in KAIST, you could get the data from me(altairlight@kaist.ac.kr) or from Ms.WooHyun Kim.

3. Now, you can follow my manual in deeplabcut/Desktop_Files/Deeplabcut Guide and enjoy your projects!

Also please contact to altairlight@kaist.ac.kr if you got stuck on some problems. Thanks!
